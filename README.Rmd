# ssdkeras package - Under Construction, use at your own risk

This is a R port to [Pierluigi Ferrari's Python implementation](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras) of Single Shot Multibox Detector - [SSD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325).

See how to use it for detecting eyes, nose and mouth on the LFW faces dataset in this post (TODO: link)

Or get the gist with `train_ssd7_faces.R`.

You should get quite good results, e.g.:

As said this is under construction though working at large. Only lightly tested on my Windows machine in which for example Python, Keras, Tensorflow are already installed. Other packages needed:

`tidyverse`, `stringr`, `reticulate`, `magick`

See `sessionInfo()`:

```{r sessionInfo, eval = FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```

```{r sessionInfo-Cache, echo = FALSE}
writeLines(readLines("~/sessionInfo_04122017.txt"))
```
